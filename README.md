# Pattern Lab Node - Grunt Edition - Starter Kit

This repository stores a custom starter kit for the Grunt edition of Pattern Lab Node.

## Prerequisites

The Pattern Lab Node - Grunt Edition uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) for core processing, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, and [grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) to run tasks and interface with the core library. Node version 4 or higher suffices. You can follow the directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on the Node website if you haven't done so already. Installation of Node will include npm. It's also highly recommended that you [install grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) globally.

## Installing

To get started with this starter kit, download or `git clone` this repository to install location. Once the starter kit is on your system, run the following commands to complete package setup:

```
cd <your_install_location>
npm install
```

`npm` is a dependency management and package system which can pull in all of the Grunt Edition's dependencies for you. Running `npm install` from the directory containing the `package.json` file will download all dependencies defined within.

## Using Pattern Lab

Pattern Lab allows you to create atomic design systems and website styleguides from the ground up.

## Using Handlebars

[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is a semantic templating language that Pattern Lab uses to bind JSON data with template files in order to generate static HTML. For a complete guide on how to use Handlebars, read the [Handlebars documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com), refer to the [Handlebars API](https://handlebarsjs.com/reference.html), and/or check out the [Handlebars project on GitHub](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js#differences-between-handlebarsjs-and-mustache).
